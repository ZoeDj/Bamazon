# Bamazon App

**Bamazon** is a command line node application that functions as Amazon-like storefront. 

The app uses MySQL database to disply and manage store inventory and npm inquirer package to take in orders from customers.

The customer selects product and quantity they would like to purchase.

If store doesn't have enough of that product in stock, the app should inform customer and prevent the order from going through.

However, if the store _does_ have enough of the product, the order would be placed. This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity and showing the total cost of the customer's purchase.
